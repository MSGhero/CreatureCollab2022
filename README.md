# CreatureCollab2022
The code for the Newgrounds Creature Collab 2022

This uses [Aidan's ECS library](https://github.com/Aidan63/ecs) and kinda serves as a working example. `Main.hx` has the list of systems that are used.

This also helped me figure out what I need to work on in the "library" I guess I'm designing now. For instance, it takes a lot of code just to put an image on the screen.
